##  User timings is an array of generic non-property-named objects.
##  To get the one you want, you have to loop thru the array and find the one with the name you want.
##  This is a common function that will do that for you.
##  Simply pass the name of the timing you want, and the ARRAY OF OBJECTS to loop thru.
##  @return {object} The requred timing object which you can then get the values (duration, start, etc) from.
